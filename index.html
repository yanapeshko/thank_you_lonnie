              <p>
                No words can express my gratitude to you. You have literally
                saved my life, and I will never forget that. Friends like you
                are hard to find. You are one in a million.
              </p>
              <p>
                Nobody has ever done so much just to make me smile. That is how
                I know that you are my guardian angel.
              </p>
              <p>
                Before I start my day, I thank God for giving me such a
                wonderful friend like you. Before I start my day today, I want
                to thank you for being part of me, of my life with its ups and
                downs.
              </p>
              <p>
                You can never imagine how much joy your support has given me
                during this critical time. Thank you, my loving friend, for your
                thoughtfulness and words of encouragement.
